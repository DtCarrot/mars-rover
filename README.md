Code Kata: Mars Rover
=======================

Instructions of the kata are given at http://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata

**Note**: To ensure that this lab focuses on OOP and TDD, we have written the code to take care of getting the users' input interactively via the commandline. To run this program, run `node src/main.js`. After completing the kata using the TDD approach, you can update `main.js` to call your functions instead.
